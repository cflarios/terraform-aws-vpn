## Version History Summary

- **v2.0.0**: Multi-region support with global VPN deployment capabilities
- **v1.1.0**: Complete English documentation and MIT licensing
- **v1.0.0**: Initial release with core VPN infrastructure automation

## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.0.0

**No Breaking Changes**: All existing single-region deployments continue to work as before.

**New Features Available**:
- Use new "Deploy Multi-Region VPN Network" workflow for global deployments
- Enhanced region selection in single-region workflows
- Improved documentation and cost management guidance

### Upgrading Existing Deployments

Existing single-region deployments are fully compatible with v2.0.0. No action required.
